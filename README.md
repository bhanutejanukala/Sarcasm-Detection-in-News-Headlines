# Sarcasm Detection In News Headlines
This project focuses on developing a sarcasm detection model tailored for news headlines. Utilizing both machine learning and deep learning techniques, the model aims to automatically detect whether a given news headline is sarcastic. In this project I used various NLP techniques for data preprocessing and the implementation of both traditional machine learning models and deep learning models is done for effective sarcasm identification.
